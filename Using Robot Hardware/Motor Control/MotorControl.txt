1) Declare the motor with its appropriate data type (e.g. private DcMotor motor)
2) In the init/runOpMode loops get their hardware according to the configuration (e.g. motor = hardwareMap.get(DcMotor.class, "motor")
3) In the same loop set the direction of the motors rotating (e.g. motor.setDirection(DcMotor.Direction.REVERSE))
4) If you are also going to use encoders it is good to set their mode at the beginning (e.g. motor.setMode(DcMotor.RunMode.STOP_AND_RESET_ENCODER))
5) Moving the motor:
    a. Without encoders:
        motor.setPower(<power>) <-- number in bracket should be from -1 to 1
    b. With encoders:
        motor.setTargetPosition(<positions>)
        motor.setMode(DcMotor.RunMode.RUN_TO_POSITION)
        motor.setPower(<power>)
 6) You can find everything about the motors and their features in the website: https://ftctechnh.github.io/ftc_app/doc/javadoc/com/qualcomm/robotcore/hardware/DcMotor.html
