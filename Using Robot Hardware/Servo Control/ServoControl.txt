1) First of all we need to program the servo using the SRS Programmer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMP4u4yogzQ)

2) Declare the servo (e.g. private Servo servo1)
3) In the init/runOpMode loops get their hardware according to the configuration (e.g. servo1 = hardwareMap.get(Servo.class, "servo1")
4) You can access the position of the servo (e.g. servo1.setPosition(<position>)) (depending on the way you program it you might need it to move on init to get the starting position)
5) You can also use the servo with continuous rotation and use it with power like the motors (e.g. cServo.setPower(<power>). But you need to declare it with another data type called CRServo (e.g. private CRServo cServo). Therefore its whole class changes to CRServo.
6) You can find everything about the servo and its features in the website: https://ftctechnh.github.io/ftc_app/doc/javadoc/index.html?com/qualcomm/robotcore/hardware/Servo.html
