1) First of all we need to program the servo using the SRS Programmer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMP4u4yogzQ)

2) Declare the servo (e.g. private Servo servo1)
3) In the init/runOpMode loops get their hardware according to the configuration (e.g. servo1 = hardwareMap.get(Servo.class, "servo1")
4) You can access the position of the servo (e.g. servo1.setPosition(<position>)) (depending on the way you program it you might need it to move on init to get the starting position)
